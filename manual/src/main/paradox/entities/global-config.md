# Global config

The global config, named `Danger zone` in Otoroshi, is the place to configure Otoroshi globally. 

> Warning: In this page, the configuration is really sensitive and affects the global behaviour of Otoroshi.


### Misc. Settings


* `Maintenance mode` : It passes every single service in maintenance mode. If a user calls a service, the maintenance page will be displayed
* `No OAuth login for BackOffice` : Forces admins to login only with user/password or user/password/u2F device
* `API Read Only`: Freeze Otoroshi datastore in read only mode. Only people with access to the actual underlying datastore will be able to disable this.
* `Auto link default` : When no group is specified on a service, it will be assigned to default one
* `Use circuit breakers` : Use circuit breaker on all services
* `Use new http client as the default Http client` : All http calls will use the new http client by default
* `Enable live metrics` : Enable live metrics in the Otoroshi cluster. Performs a lot of writes in the datastore
* `Digitus medius` : Use middle finger emoji as a response character for endless HTTP responses (see [IP address filtering settings](#ip-address-filtering-settings)).
* `Limit conc. req.` : Limit the number of concurrent request processed by Otoroshi to a certain amount. Highly recommended for resilience
* `Use X-Forwarded-* headers for routing` : When evaluating routing of a request, X-Forwarded-* headers will be used if presents
* `Max conc. req.` : Maximum number of concurrent requests processed by otoroshi.
* `Max HTTP/1.0 resp. size` : Maximum size of an HTTP/1.0 response in bytes. After this limit, response will be cut and sent as is. The best value here should satisfy (maxConcurrentRequests * maxHttp10ResponseSize) < process.memory for worst case scenario.
* `Max local events` : Maximum number of events stored.
* `Lines` : *deprecated* 

### IP address filtering settings

* `IP allowed list`: Only IP addresses that will be able to access Otoroshi exposed services
* `IP blocklist`: IP addresses that will be refused to access Otoroshi exposed services
